# Global Cyber AI Advancement - Darktrace

## Overview and Origin

Company: Darktrace

Location(s):
Europe, North America, the Middle East, Asia, and Latin America

Dual headquarters: Cambridge, UK ; San Fransisco, CA

Startup Location: Cambridge, UK

Year incorporated: 2013

Founders: Poppy Gustafsson, Dave Palmer, Emily Orton, Jack Stockdale and Nicole Eagan.

Mission motivation: The company's idea came about in 2013: "A world-class team of mathematicians from the University of Cambridge and AI experts were working on some ground-breaking applications of AI, experimenting with giving machines a sense of self.” Upon looking around at the newly increasing demands of cybersecurity, and seeing how much improvement could be made, they teamed up with GCHQ, looking to turn the tables. They saw and took the opportunity to provide higher security with AI that analysts alone can’t.

* Darktrace’s mission is to provide security for any business or organization, anywhere, anytime.

* “At its heart, Darktrace is a company that uses advanced mathematics to solve real world problems.” - Darktrace's CEO, Poppy Gustafsson

Funding: The company is mainly funded by investors, and has been funded $4.3 Billion across 519 investors. This includes a notable investment in 2018 led by Vitruvian Partners, for the Series E funding, bringing the total value of Series E to $1.65 billion.

## Business Activities

* With Darktrace, security teams have seen a reduction in triage time by over 90%

* 9,000+ customers from small businesses to large enterprises

* 2,200+ employees

* 110 different countries

* They are the first company to take Cyber AI to the lengths and high standards that Darktrace has. They are leading the world with Cyber AI, and with this, the UK awarded the CEO, Poppy Gustafsson, and CTO OBEs in 2019.

Note: An OBE is apart of the British honors system and is a prestigious award to people who have made notable advancement within and for the Untied Kingdom.

## Possible Steps Forward
I would advise expanding security coverage beyond the business realm and introducing more services for the public. Darktrace wants to “break the glass ceiling”, which is an outstanding goal. So far, they have proven themselves to be a standard setting company willing and capable of doing just that. With that, they "broke the glass ceiling" back in 2013 before Cyber AI was widely known, now it's time to break the new glass ceiling, including expansion beyond their current “business only” scope. Schools, hospitals, and financial institutions are a big global target that isn’t going anywhere and needs to be protected by people with first level skills and experience. To protect national security, civilians across the world, and everyone leading, there first needs to be stability. How do we get that? - A great starting point is to limit outsiders (anyone who does not have rightful business with that information) access to any and all sensitive data - regardless of the contaminants. To do this, we need the greatest engineers and mathematicians continually working to improve our networks and strategies to prevent and defend. Where do we get that? - Companies like Darktrace already have fully developed teams doing just this. The main problem is that the scope or focused area of each individual company typically stays small. Having one, or multiple companies come together to expand and stand ground is what we need to have a solid shot of keeping everyone's privacy private and safe. The beginning of that expansion process would include schools, hospitals, and financial institutions. Why? - They are three of the biggest global targets of attack, and that is because they are all extremely crucial for societal survival and function. Though cybersecurity will not protect these areas entirely, it is certainly the place to start. Though this isn't necessarily the case, What good do other “securities” do if it’s more than relatively possible to access all the information needed to disrupt crucial patterns?

### Implementable Technology Ideas

* Varying new persons recognition technology

  * Building surveillance including immediate persons recognition technology (with access to broad government software and data - for applicable uses)

* Limited, and regularly re-approved access points (AI re-approved?)
  * Note: Access points in places like banks for example, where the limited number of people who have access are regularly re-approved using AI to gather all new or already existing information on the person with               access - "re-approved" also referencing the technology itself, rather than just the person gaining access

* In-depth AI oversight of all operations (supervised)
  * Applicable to what the technology is being used for: Supervised oversight of operations using AI to collect new and already existing data on performance levels and suggested ways of improvement, along with the       predicted outcome analysis of each improvement suggestion

Put shortly, I believe these technology ideas to be an appropriate solution because each of them increases security, and decreases the chances of a breach, therefore, better protecting national security and everyone under it's protection.
